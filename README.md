# designer-rate-installation
This project was created in order to be included in the space of a big conference of design. 
This installation is composed of an arduino ultrasonic sensor detecting the arrival of a person in front of the installation. Then, a computer with a webcam detects the person's face and its emotions. These values are used to define the rate of design inside the user of the experience. The results are given using the computer's voice. 

### Prerequisites

Material you will need :
- a computer with a webcam
- an arduino uno board
- 4 arduino cables
- an ultrasonic arduino sensor

In order to make this project run you will need to install on your computer : 
- node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- the arduino software (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)
- johnny-five (http://johnny-five.io/)


```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
